# Label lab result
 will automatically labels lab results when the lab result is opened.

o	(show example of lab result in the e-chart, before and after).
o	Hovering your mouse over the text gives more details. It will only label lab results if it is an empty label, or hasn't yet been set, or if previously labelled by this script (as evidenced by ending in '...'). So, It Will not override manually labelled results (unless it ends in '...'). 
o	The new labelled name will show up in the Echart as well
