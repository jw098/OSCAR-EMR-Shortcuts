# Check time codes for LFP billing
- If the Service code is one of the LFP time codes: 98010, 11, or 12. When you click the "Continue" button, it ensures that you have start and end times, and that the number of units for time-based billing do not exceed the time difference between start and end time. 
o	For example: Suppose you enter in 5 units. Start time is 1000. End time is 1100. Click Continue. You will get a warning. Because 10:00 to 11:00 is only 1 hour, for which you can only bill a maximum of 4 units. 4 units is less than 5 units, so the program gives you a warning.

# Buttons to input billing codes
o	You can have up to 3 groups, or rows, of buttons. You can see here "Row 1", "Row 2", and "Row 3".
	You can have as many buttons as you want in each group. The purpose of having separate rows or groups is for organization.
o	Here are the default buttons that I've added. You can add or remove buttons.
o	"Add New": This adds a new button. Click the checkbox to enable the button. You can then add the button name: let's do "test". The service code: let's do "00100", and diagnostic code: let's do "401".
	Now, let's Save. Then go back to the billing page and refresh. We can see our button "test". 
•	Let's click it. You can see the service code is 00100. An Dx1 is 401.
	Back to the settings page. 
•	You can also add other service codes and diagnostic codes. 
•	You can also add a keyboard shortcut. To set shortcuts: place your cursor in the box for the shortcut that you want to change. Then type your shortcut. For example, CTRL+SHIFT+G. Then click outside of the box. We'll talk more about shortcuts near the end of the video.
•	You can also set the Billing code type. For Standard billing code. Whatever you put into the Service and Diagnostic code boxes here, these codes will overwrite their respective box when you click the button. But for "Billing addon", it will add these Service and diagnostic codes to the next available box, and will not overwrite anything.
o	For example: let's set "Test" to "Billing addon". When you click this "Clinic visit" button. 98031, will be pasted to the Service code 1 box, overwriting whatever was in it before. If the billing code type is Addon billing: When you click this Test button, 00100
