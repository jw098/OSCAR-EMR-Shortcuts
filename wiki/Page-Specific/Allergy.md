## Buttons to quickly add allergies
- On the Medications page, 3 extra red buttons will be added. When no allergies are set, the buttons will be highlighted red. This reminds you to set the patient's allergies. There are 3 buttons: No known drug allergies. Add Penicillin Allergy and Add sulfa allergy. If you click "Set NKDA". It will click through all the pages, and bring you back to your original page. And as you can see: NKDA is now listed on the chart.
o	"Set NKDA" will then be replaced with "Remove NKDA". If you click this, it will ask you to confirm. Click OK. It then brings you back to your original page. And as you can see: NKDA is now removed from the chart. And the red buttons are back.
•	If you click "Add Penicillin Allergy", you will be prompted to add a reaction. For example, let's type in "hives". If you click this red button, you will be brought back to the Medications page. Now Penicillins is listed as an allergy. And the red buttons are now gone, since the allergies field is no longer empty.
•	If you go to the Allergies page. The buttons are back. Unlike the medications page, these don't go away.
