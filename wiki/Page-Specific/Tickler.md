# When clicking the button 'Submit (tickler) and Exit', post the tickler message to the E-Chart

o	For example: Let's create a tickler to Staff MOA: Test 123. Submit and Exit.
ï‚§	It automatically pastes this to the echart. And clearly states who the message was sent to.
- depending on your version of OSCAR, clicking "Submit and Exit" may or may not refresh the E-Chart page. This function *should* work either way.
