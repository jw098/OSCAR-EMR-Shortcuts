# Update sidebar after posting new eForms, Meds, Consults, Ticklers without needing to refresh
 This feature does as it says
o	[echart] For example, let's post a new Lab req eForm [open and post lab req]. After a second, you can see it show up here.
# eForm search bar
This creates a new search bar. It's green in color. You can search for eforms by title. It does a better job of searching for eforms than the default searchbar.
o	For example. Let's search for the NIPT. And we can see "Panorama NIPT" [open eform]. That's what we want.
ï‚§	If we type in NIPT into the default searchbar. We get nothing.

# Add demographic information to eChart header
o	[e-chart] This is everything listed here. [highlight the demographic info in header]
o	You can see all the patient's phone numbers. You can see their address, PHN, email. 
o	You also get a button that automatically opens Careconnect. [open careconnect] Once careconnect is opened, the PHN will also automatically be pasted into the search bar.

# Buttons for measurements
o	[e-chart] For example: This button opens the Measurement group for Vitals. Instead of hovering over this plus sign, then clicking Vitals [do this to open Vitals manually].
- You can create more measurement groups in OSCAR by adjusting your settings in OSCAR's Administration tab

# Buttons for opening eforms
o	[e-chart] For example: This button opens the lab req eform. 
- you need to set FID for the eforms to be set correctly
