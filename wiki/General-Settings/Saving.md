# Saving settings
- When settings are changed, the "Save" button will turn green.
- If the settings are changed back, the green highlighting will go away.
  - as of this writing, the only exception to this is that if you add new buttons, the "Save" button will turn green the moment you place your cursor in any of it's fields, even if no changes are made.
- Clicking the "Save" button will also clear the green highlighting
