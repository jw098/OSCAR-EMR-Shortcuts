# OSCAR-EMR-ShortCuts

Keyboard shortcuts, buttons, automated actions for OSCAR EMR.

# Features:

- Automated actions (e.g. renaming lab results)

- Buttons for common actions (e.g. open e-forms)

- Keyboard shortcuts for commonly used actions

# Disclaimer:

This extension has only been tested on the WELL Health implementation of OSCAR EMR, in BC, in Classic view. Due to the nature of a browser extension, I am unable to guarantee it will work with every EMR update, and you use it at your own risk. Using this web extension may result in errant behavior in the EMR.

Feel free to contact me if you notice any bugs. Please also reach out if you have a different version of OSCAR and are interested in getting this extension to work in your OSCAR version.
